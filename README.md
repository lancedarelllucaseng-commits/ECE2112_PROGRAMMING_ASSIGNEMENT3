Advanced Computer Programming S.Y 25-26

Name: Luc4s, L4nce D4rell M.
Section: 2ECE-C
Date Submitted: September 16, 2025

Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
2. 2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library 

CONTENTS OF THIS ASSIGNMENT:

PROBLEM 1: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py 
Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations: 
a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas 
b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars. 

PROBLEM 2: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py 
Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations. 
a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars. 
b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’. 
c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have? 
d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have. 

NOTES: 
In order to accomplish this programming I had to access my notes last meeting, learning how to save the file again in the same folder with the given excel file and accessing that file into jupyter notebook. For example Problem 1 a. Printing the first five rows of cars using the function cars.head(). Also needed help from the internet about errors in the code.

HOW TO OPEN/RUN THE FILE:
1. OPEN THE LINK AND GO TO THE REPOSITORY
2. DOWNLOAD THE FILES ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT WERE SAVED DURING CODING, THAT IS WITH THIS README FILE
3. OPEN IT WITH JUPYTER NOTEBOOK AND THEN RUN 
4. THANK YOU!
